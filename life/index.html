    <li><b>Photography:</b> I started taking photographs when I was about 12, processing black and white film, I set up my own darkroom, experimented with film speed pushing, tri-colour printing etc.  I also have a collection of early cameras, the best being a 1909 Thornton and Pickard plate camera, and several early Exacta Single Lens Reflex 35mm cameras.  Today I use digital cameras, a Sony Mirrorless, Insta 360 (great for cycling) and a Mavic Pro.</li>
    <li><b>Cycling:</b> I like cycling and cycle touring, I also have a collection of cycles, mainly back in the UK.  My favourite is a 1981 Dawes Galaxy, a classic steel touring bike, but actually the bike I use the most, and I have with here in Vietnam is my lovely Brompton, the one I have with me is a 2008 P6R, its so versatile, and great for mix mode travel, as it folds down and can be carried by car/train/bus/plane (and even at a pinch on a motorbike).</li>
    <li><b>Pistol Target Shooting</b> My sport in the UK, which I cannot carry on in Vietnam was competitive target pistol shooting. My 'event' is the 10m air pistol, using a model of Olympic target pistol, mine is a Hammerly.  A great relaxing sport. You cant shoot if you are tense or worried, teaches you great relaxation.</li>
    <li><b>...and the others</b> Well things I've tried but can't at the moment do. <i>Heavy glider flying</i> is one, I've done some test flights, but I'd really like to get my pilots licence.  Alas not possible in Vietnam, but Thailand has a Flying Club that does the short courses....   <i>Caving</i> Actually I did some in the UK, but the magnificent caves in Vietnam are crying out to me!  Only managed one brief exersion so far, but I will go again...  <i>Scuba diving</i> I've done a few dives, and when the water is right its magnificent, but its quite risky, but I remain tempted to try again here...
