	Biography
Hi, I worked in Higher Education in a variety of UK universities since the 1980s, since 1996 in the University of Portsmouth. Actually I am a Psychologist by background, and I got into teaching in Computing after completing my PhD in the UK Open University, Mathematics Faculty, Department of Computing. One aspect of my work is as a Cognitive Ergonomist designing and evaluating how people and computers interact with each other, so that involves Human Computer Interaction. Its a branch of Software Engineering, that involves understanding how software is constructed, and also how humans think, perceive and store information. One aspect I've been interested in is the use of simulation in teaching. I am also interested in how people use computers for 'nefarious' purposes (i.e. to commit crimes, or penetrate 'secure' systems), and I have worked with the UK Police Services in Computer Forensics, as well as having qualifications in use of specialist forensics software.
